I have just talked to Jonathan the staff member for Life Directions. As part of the nursing program you have to complete 15 hours of service per quarter until you graduate. Van knows this which is why he was talking long term. Now, you don''t have to continue service at Life Directions for the remainder of your career at DePaul but it would be a lot easier if you could stay with one organization.  That is where the miscommunication is, so again you only have to complete 15 hours. But when Van was talking to you he already knows that the Nursing students have to continue working with a non-profit until they graduate so he was just assuming that you were going to be there until the program is over.  I have CC''d the other two classmates on this email and I have included Jonathan who is the staff member for the class, and Charlotte Phillips who is my direct boss. If you have any other questions or concerns','Winter 2013',null,null,null);

I am emailing you because I need a hours update from you. It is the end of week six and we will be sending out reports to your professor next week. It is very important that you email me with an hours update. I need to know how many hours you will have completed by the end of Friday February 15, 2013.  Again, failing to communicate with me can effect your grade in the class. If there is no communication then we don''t know if you are doing your hours, which means your professor doesn''t know if you are doing your hours.  Finally, the yellow sheets get handed into your professor at the end of the quarter. The organization may ask to make a copy but make sure the actual yellow sheet is handed to your professor.

We had a meeting with Andrew Johnson and Cindy Fox Star for about an hour. We set up an orientation for Monday at 1030am. The three of us also gave our contact info  and days that we are available for service learning to Andrew so that we can get started on completing our 16 hours.

It''s been a pretty busy week. My name is Jordan Keller, and I''m one of the nursing students working with LLS. We had our first meeting with Jennifer last week and went over the mission and what they have in mind for us, but we won''t be getting on site until the 13th. I don''t think they took the quarter system into account and thought we were on semesters, so the timeline is a bit off. But I will be in touch after that first day on site, Of course, I''m available to talk any time leading up to that if you have any other questions/concerns.
