If there is absolutely nothing to do at the Humboldt park location and you have availability at the Austin location Thursday''s and Friday''s then that would be okay with me.

I signed up to my service learning hours at St. Joseph. I attended orientation earlier this week on Monday. I talk to Beatrice and told her if she can notify right away with dates and times that I had to go in and serve my hours. The purpose of that was because I work and I have to request those days off weeks prior to those days. I still have not heard of Beatrice of when I should go in. There is also this requirement of taking a Virtus training since most of the programs works with kids. The issue with that is that Virtus training is not offered in Chicago, they are often in the outside suburbs. It is difficult for me to attend since I work. My issue is that I''m worried that I wont be able to complete my 20 hours by the end of the quarter. I''m hoping that you can help me solve something so I can start on my hours.
